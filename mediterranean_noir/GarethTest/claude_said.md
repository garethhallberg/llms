# The Alligator Series

The Alligator series is written by Italian author **Massimo Carlotto**, who is an important figure in Mediterranean noir fiction. The series features protagonist **Marco Buratti**, also known as "Alligator," who is an ex-convict turned private investigator.

## Key Information About the Series:

1. **Main Character**: Marco Buratti (nicknamed "Alligator") is described as having a rugged and complex depiction of masculinity. He navigates a world filled with moral ambiguity and social injustice.

2. **Character Development**: Buratti is characterized by deep emotional scars, shaped by his experiences and the injustices he has faced. His character provides a lens through which Carlotto explores complex themes of morality, justice, and societal impact.

3. **Setting**: Unlike some Mediterranean noir that focuses on rural settings, Carlotto's works often depict the isolation and suffocating nature of small communities. In his novel **The Goodbye Kiss** (which may be part of or related to the Alligator series), the seemingly idyllic surroundings contrast sharply with the violence that erupts.

4. **Theme of Sexual Identity**: In these books, Buratti's relationships are described as "fraught with tension and frailty." His attraction to women reflects his deeper need for connection and belonging in an unforgiving world. Carlotto uses these interactions to explore themes of gender identity and the impact of societal pressures on male relationships.

5. **Social Commentary**: The series appears to examine the intersection of sexual identity and social class. Buratti's relationships illuminate how societal pressures around masculinity and reputation can shape personal choices.

6. **Symbolism**: In Carlotto's works, natural elements like the Mediterranean sea are portrayed as symbolic - representing both freedom and entrapment, reflecting the internal conflicts faced by characters who long for liberation but are tethered by their inner demons and societal expectations.

The Alligator series appears to be a significant work in the Mediterranean noir genre, with Carlotto using his protagonist to explore deeper societal issues while maintaining the tension and atmosphere characteristic of noir fiction.
