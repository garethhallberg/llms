To insert a booking for Mr. Dave Smith and his wife for a two-night stay starting on the 4th of April, you would use the following SQL query. Note that we'll assume the `mail` field is used to store the guest's name for this example, and we'll use the current date for the `booking_date`. Also, we'll generate a new `booking_ID` using a function that increments the highest existing ID by 1. Here's the SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO guesthouse (mail, start_date, end_date, booking_date, booking_ID)
VALUES (
    'Mr Dave Smith and his wife',
    '2023-04-04',  -- Assuming the year is 2023; adjust as necessary
    '2023-04-06',  -- Two nights from April 4th would end on April 6th
    CURDATE(),     -- Current date as the booking date
    (SELECT IFNULL(MAX(booking_ID), 0) + 1 FROM guesthouse)  -- New booking ID
);
```

Please note the following:
- The `CURDATE()` function is used to insert the current date as the `booking_date`. If you want a specific booking date, replace `CURDATE()` with that date.
- The `start_date` and `end_date` are set for April 4th to April 6th, 2023. Adjust the year if necessary.
- The `mail` field is used here to store the guest's name. If this field is intended for email addresses, you should replace `'Mr Dave Smith and his wife'` with an appropriate email address.
- The `booking_ID` is generated by finding the highest existing ID and adding 1 to it. If no IDs exist yet, it starts at 1. If your database uses a different method for generating IDs (like an auto-incrementing field), you should adjust this part of the query accordingly.
