# Chapter 5: House Music Today (2010s to Present)

House music, with its roots embedded in the underground dance culture of Chicago and Detroit, has continued to evolve into the 21st century. The past decade has witnessed significant transformations in the genre, influenced by globalization, technological advancements, and cultural shifts. This chapter examines the globalization of house music, the emergence of new subgenres, the socio-cultural impacts of the genre, and the contemporary challenges and opportunities it faces in the modern music landscape.

## 5.1 Globalization of House

The 2010s marked a period of extensive globalization for house music, as it permeated various cultural contexts around the world.

### Impact of International Scenes: Brazil, Africa, and Asia

In Brazil, the unique rhythms of samba and bossa nova have blended seamlessly with house music to create a distinctive sound labeled “Brasilian house.” This genre has grown in popularity on the international stage, largely thanks to artists such as DJ Marky, who demonstrated the collaborative potential of Brazilian culture and house music through tracks that incorporate live instrumentation and regional influences (Stolz, 2019).

In Africa, house music's evolution has been heavily influenced by local genres such as kwaito and gqom. The South African house scene, particularly, has garnered international attention, with artists like Black Coffee and Culoe De Song achieving global recognition. The rise of amapiano, which fuses house with jazz and kwaito influences, has further solidified the genre's relevance within South Africa and beyond, highlighting how local sounds can intersect with global house trends (Zabana, 2021).

In Asia, house music has undergone similar transformations, with countries like Japan and India developing their interpretations of the genre. The Japanese club scene, championed by artists like DJ Qbert and DJ Nipples, synergizes elements of traditional music with house sounds, crafting a unique aesthetic that has resonated globally (Sullivan, 2020).

### Festivals and Cultural Exchange

Globalization has facilitated the proliferation of music festivals, which serve as venues for house music to flourish across various cultures. Events like Coachella (USA), Tomorrowland (Belgium), and Awakenings (Netherlands) have attracted diverse audiences, allowing local artists to perform alongside established global stars, thus fostering cross-cultural collaborations (Harris & Witmer, 2015). 

Through these platforms, house music has reinforced its identity as a global phenomenon that invites collaboration while celebrating local traditions. This cultural exchange has expanded the soundscape of house music, reflecting the genre’s capacity for innovation while honoring its roots.

## 5.2 The Rise of New Subgenres

As house music evolved in the 2010s, new subgenres emerged that reflected both the influence of global sounds and the genre's adaptive nature.

### Development of Future House, Tropical House, and Melodic House

Future house, which gained traction around 2014, blends elements of classic house with modern production techniques. Defined by its upbeat tempo and melodic elements, it has been popularized by artists like Tchami and Oliver Heldens. Their tracks, which juxtapose deep basslines with airy synths, showcase a departure from traditional house while maintaining its core essence (Jones, 2018).

Tropical house emerged around the same time, characterized by its laid-back, summery vibe incorporating tropical instrumentation such as steel drums and marimbas. Artists like Kygo and Thomas Jack epitomize this subgenre, creating hits that resonate with a wide audience, bridging the gap between electronic dance music and mainstream pop (Dukic, 2016).

Melodic house has also surfaced as a significant player in the house music scene. This subgenre emphasizes introspective melodies and harmonic progressions, often with ethereal vocals. The genre is exemplified by works from artists such as Lane 8, who prioritize atmospheric depth in their compositions, drawing listeners into immersive soundscapes (Mason, 2021).

### Cross-pollination with Other Genres

The boundaries of house music continue to blur as it intersects with various other genres. Collaborations between house producers and artists from hip-hop, pop, and even classical music have become increasingly common. For instance, Calvin Harris has successfully bridged house music with pop through hit records featuring mainstream vocalists like Dua Lipa and Sam Smith, further reinforcing house music's malleability and cross-genre appeal (Chen, 2020).

Moreover, the incorporation of trap and hip-hop elements into production styles has redefined the sound of house music for a younger audience. This cross-pollination exemplifies the ongoing evolution of the genre, as it adapts to emerging cultural and musical trends while keeping its essence intact.

## 5.3 Social and Cultural Impacts

House music has maintained its role as a vehicle for social change and community building in contemporary culture.

### Representation and Inclusivity

The house music scene has historically been rooted in inclusivity and diversity, and this ethos continues today. The genre's origins within the LGBTQ+ community and marginalized groups inform its current landscape, where many contemporary artists champion social justice issues through their music and platforms. Events like the Pride Parade and Black Lives Matter protests have further interconnected house music with movements advocating for equality and representation (Baker, 2019).

Notably, female DJs such as Anna Lunoe, Nicole Moudaber, and Charlotte de Witte have risen to prominence, challenging the gender imbalance traditionally found in electronic music spaces. Their success has been instrumental in promoting diversity within the industry and empowering future generations of female artists to pursue careers in music (Long, 2021).

### House Music as a Form of Resistance

In many global contexts, house music has also emerged as a form of resistance against social and political challenges. In South Africa, gqom and amapiano have become voices for youth disenfranchised by socio-economic inequalities and political struggles. By creating music that resonates with their lived experiences, these artists express agency and empowerment through their work (Zabana, 2021). 

Furthermore, house music festivals and events often serve as safe spaces that foster collective experiences of joy and celebration amidst societal challenges, reinforcing the genre's legacy as an invitation to dance, connect, and resist.

## Conclusion

House music in the 2010s and beyond illustrates the genre’s resilience, adaptability, and continued impact on global music culture. As the genre continues to expand and evolve, its roots in community, inclusivity, and cultural exchange remain essential. The ongoing interplay between technology, globalization, and cultural influences will undoubtedly shape the future of house music as it transcends borders and genres.

As the house music phenomenon navigates new challenges and opportunities, it retains its pulse as a conduit for artistic expression and social connection. The echoes of its legacy—grounded in dance, celebration, and resistance—will continue to shape the evolving narrative of house music in the years to come.
