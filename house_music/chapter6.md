# Chapter 3: Evolution and Subgenres (1990s)

As house music continued to evolve through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, its landscape became increasingly diverse, giving rise to a wide range of subgenres. This chapter explores the diversification of sound within house music, introducing listeners to various subgenres such as deep house, progressive house, and vocal house. It also highlights notable artists and influential labels during this period, examining their contributions to the house music narrative. Finally, it delves into the significance of rave culture and the delicate balance between underground movements and commercial pressures.

## 3.1 Diversification of Sound

The 1990s witnessed an explosion of creativity in the house music scene, with producers and DJs experimenting with different sounds, rhythms, and textures.

### Introduction of Subgenres: Deep House, Progressive House, and Vocal House

Deep house emerged as a distinct subgenre characterized by its soulful melodies, complex chord progressions, and lush atmospheres. Drawing influences from jazz and funk, artists like Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) and Kerri Chandler became pioneers of this sound. Tracks such as “Can You Feel It” and “Atmosphere” exemplified deep house’s ability to create immersive listening experiences, emphasizing mood and emotion.

Conversely, progressive house presented a more melodic and evolving structure. Influenced by the techno sounds coming from Detroit and the UK, progressive house featured longer tracks that gradually built tension and introduced elements over time. This subgenre was popularized by labels like Perfecto and artists such as Sasha, John Digweed, and Hernan Cattaneo. Tracks like “Xpander” by Sasha became anthems in the burgeoning festival scene, illustrating the genre's cinematic quality and emotional depth.

Vocal house, as the name implies, placed a significant emphasis on vocals, often incorporating catchy hooks and emotional lyrics. Artists such as Crystal Waters with her hit “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless)” and the duo The Nightcrawlers with “Push the Feeling On” highlighted the appeal of catchy vocal lines combined with infectious beats, granting house music broader commercial appeal.

### Cross-Pollination of Other Genres

As house music splintered into various subgenres, it began to interact with other musical styles, leading to the emergence of hybrid genres. The collaboration between house and hip-hop saw innovative productions that blended beats, sampling, and vocal styles. DJ Marky from Brazil brought Brazilian rhythms into the mix, effectively creating a smooth fusion of house and Latin sounds.

Simultaneously, the UK garage scene was burgeoning with a distinctive sound that drew heavily from house, R&B, and hip-hop, leading to the development of artists like MJ Cole and the influential compilation series “Garage Classics.” UK garage, with its syncopated rhythms and chopped vocal samples, became a precursor to both grime and the development of future bass music, illustrating how house music creatively transformed and influenced the music landscape in the 1990s.

## 3.2 Notable Artists and Labels

The 1990s were marked by several influential artists and record labels that would shape the trajectory of house music for years to come.

### Profile of Influential Artists: Masters At Work, Armand Van Helden, and Daft Punk

Masters At Work, the duo of Kenny Dope and Louie Vega, were instrumental in the evolution of house music during the 1990s. Known for their dynamic productions that embraced elements of Latin, funk, and broken beat, their remixes of tracks like “I Can’t Get No Sleep” by Masters At Work and “Deep Inside” by Hardrive became cornerstones of the genre.

Armand Van Helden played a crucial role in bridging house music into the mainstream. His hit “Professional Widow,” featuring the iconic vocal sample from Tori Amos, gained tremendous popularity in clubs and radio stations alike, epitomizing the crossover appeal that house music achieved. 

The French duo Daft Punk exploded onto the scene in the latter half of the 1990s with their pioneering blend of house, funk, and disco. With their debut album *Homework* in 1997, tracks like “Around the World” and “Da Funk” showcased their infectious grooves and innovative production techniques, setting the stage for a new wave of electronic music that would dominate the 2000s.

### Significance of Record Labels: Strictly Rhythm, Def Mix Productions, and Nervous Records

Record labels played a paramount role in the dissemination and development of house music during this era. Strictly Rhythm, founded in 1989, became a cornerstone of house music, delivering influential releases from artists like George Morel and Roger Sanchez. The label’s dedication to producing high-quality tracks made it synonymous with the house sound of the 1990s.

Def Mix Productions, led by legendary figures such as Frankie Knuckles and David Morales, championed the deeper, soul-infused side of house and ensured that the artistry of DJing and remix culture was respected and preserved. With its roster of notable producers and its commitment to high production standards, Def Mix helped solidify house music’s position in the mainstream.

Nervous Records, another influential label that emerged in the 1990s, specialized in releasing tracks that encapsulated the vitality of house music. Their focus on a mix of house influences from deep, soulful sounds to more upbeat, dancefloor-friendly tracks contributed to their reputation as a go-to label for underground hits.

## 3.3 The Significance of Rave Culture

Rave culture remained integral to the identity of house music throughout the 1990s, with the energy and ethos of underground parties serving as its lifeblood.

### The Connection Between Rave and House Music

Raves, often characterized by their secretive locations and all-night dance parties, embodied the spirit of freedom and expression. They provided a platform for many subgenres of house music, played by a diverse roster of DJs who embraced the essence of the party culture. The experience of uniting under pulsating beats, vibrant visuals, and a sense of shared joy became a hallmark of the rave scene.

The DIY ethos of rave culture challenged societal norms, promoting ideals of inclusivity and hedonism. These gatherings celebrated diversity as attendees from various backgrounds would come together in a communal experience that highlighted unity through music.

### The Balance Between Underground Movements and Commercial Pressures

While rave culture flourished, it also became clear that commercial pressures were rising as house music gained mainstream traction. Major music festivals began to emerge, sometimes diluting the underground experience that had previously defined the rave scene. Large events risked losing the grassroots authenticity and connection of smaller, community-based gatherings.

This tension between the underground and commercialism sparked conversations within the community about the integrity and future of house music. Some artists and promoters staunchly defended the grassroots movements, fearing that larger festivals would compromise the very ideals that had elevated house music into a cultural phenomenon.

Although some aspects of rave culture became commercialized, many underground events continued to flourish, preserving the original spirit of house music while simultaneously facilitating its evolution into new territories. This dynamic interplay between mainstream appeal and underground resilience characterized the 1990s, setting the stage for the next wave of musical innovation in the following decades.
